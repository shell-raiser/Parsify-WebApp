# Parsify
A Web App and API made for the [Codefiesta 2022](https://unstop.com/hackathon/codefiesta-sir-m-visvesvaraya-institute-of-technology-smvit-bengaluru-364352) Hackathon

### AWS Hosting 
It is hosted on AWS for demoing http://ec2-54-174-113-31.compute-1.amazonaws.com:3000 <br>
It takes time to OCR the PDF after uploading. Have Patience ðŸ˜„ <br>
For now, this works great only for PDFs in [this format](https://firhtml.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d5ffa24cc24c635c2105d05f31f03ecd)

## Problem statement: PDF parser for FIR copy
There are crores of FIR copies stored in pdfâ€™s from all over india in various states which are present in regional languages which need to be parsed and the information need to collected.


## Our Solution:
* A Web App for uploading a PDF (or a PDF URL) and obtaining a JSON String with all the necessary info about the FIR, nicely formatted inside the HTML page, available for copy-pasting.

* An API for batch-processing multiple files and getting JSON Object as a response. Which can be directly stored in a NoSQL DB like MongoDB.
