**Problem statement:** PDF parser for FIR copy <br>
There are crores of FIR copies  stored in pdfâ€™s from all over india in various states which are present in regional languages which need to be parsed and the information need to collected.

solution:<br>
* Since the FIR copies collected are in regional languages we will need to extract the information and translate them to standard english 
* Extracting the information can by done using OCR (Optical character recognition). 
* Once information is collected we can parse the information and extract the required fields from the information and store it
